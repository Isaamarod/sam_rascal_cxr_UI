# 🎉 Welcome to the RASCAL-SAM Voting App! 🎉

The goal of this project is to compare the performance of a general segmentation model like **SAM** with expert-driven lung segmentation using boundary boxes (red squares in the images). By leveraging batch segmentation, this approach aims to save time while maintaining accuracy.
